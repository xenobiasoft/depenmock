## Release Process

DepenMock uses GitHub Actions to automate the release process. When a new version is ready to be released:

### Creating a Release

1. **Tag the Release**: Create and push a git tag with the version number prefixed with `v`:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. **Automated Workflows**: Pushing a tag triggers two GitHub Actions workflows:
   - **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Creates a GitHub Release with:
     - Automatically generated release notes from commits
     - Package information and installation instructions
     - Links to all published NuGet packages
   
   - **Publish Workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`): Builds and publishes NuGet packages:
     - DepenMock (Core library)
     - DepenMock.NUnit
     - DepenMock.XUnit
     - DepenMock.MSTest

3. **Release Notes**: The release notes are automatically generated by GitHub based on:
   - Pull requests merged since the last release
   - Commits with conventional commit messages
   - Issues closed since the last release

### Version Management

- Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- The version is extracted from the git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3` â†’ `1.2.3`)
- All NuGet packages are published with the same version number

### Build and Test

Before creating a release, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

## Testing

The project includes test projects for multiple testing frameworks:
- Tests.NUnit
- Tests.XUnit  
- Tests.MSTest

Run tests with:
```bash
dotnet test
```
